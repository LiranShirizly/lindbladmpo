	abstract = {We study the nonequilibrium dynamics in the fermionic Hubbard model after a sudden change of the interaction strength. To this scope, we introduce a time-dependent variational approach in the spirit of the Gutzwiller ansatz. At the saddle-point approximation, we find at half filling a sharp transition between two different regimes of small and large coherent oscillations, separated by a critical line of quenches where the system is found to relax. Any finite doping washes out the transition, leaving aside just a sharp crossover. In order to investigate the role of quantum fluctuations, we map the model onto an auxiliary quantum Ising model in a transverse field coupled to free fermionic quasiparticles. Remarkably, the Gutzwiller approximation turns out to correspond to the mean-field decoupling of this model in the limit of infinite coordination lattices. The advantage is that we can go beyond mean field and include Gaussian fluctuations around the non-equilibrium mean-field dynamics. Unlike at 
equilibrium, we find that quantum fluctuations become massless and eventually unstable before the mean-field dynamical critical line, which suggests they could even alter qualitatively the mean-field scenario.},

We explore the concept of topological order in this setting, developing and applying a general theoretical framework based on the system density matrix that replaces the wave function appropriate for the discussion of Hamiltonian ground-state physics. We identify key analogies and differences to the more conventional Hamiltonian scenario. Differences essentially arise from the fact that the properties of the spectrum and of the state of the system are not as tightly related as in the Hamiltonian context. We provide a symmetry-based topological classification of bulk steady states and identify the classes that are achievable by means of quasi-local dissipative processes driving into 
superfluid paired states. We also explore the fate of the bulk-edge correspondence in the dissipative setting and demonstrate the emergence of Majorana edge modes. We illustrate our findings in one- and two-dimensional models that are experimentally realistic in the context of cold atoms.},

The advent of numerous experimental platforms that simulate such dynamics poses an immediate challenge to systematically understand and classify these models. In particular, nontrivial many-body states emerge as steady states under non-equilibrium dynamics. While these states and their phase transitions have been studied extensively with mean field theory, the validity of the mean field approximation has not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we employ a field-theoretic approach based on the Keldysh formalism to study nonequilibrium phases and phase transitions in a variety of models. In all cases, a complete description via the Keldysh formalism indicates a partial or complete failure of the mean field analysis. Furthermore, we find that an effective temperature emerges as a result of dissipation, and the 
universal behavior including the dynamics near the steady state is generically described by a thermodynamic universality class.},

We discuss this phenomenon both numerically and analytically, through a mapping onto a \$N\$-dimensional Anderson model. The thermodynamic limit \$N{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}infty\$, in particular, always shows unbounded energy growth. This dynamical delocalization is genuinely quantum and very different from the classical one: using a mean field approximation we see that the system self-organizes so that the energy per site increases in time as a power law with exponent smaller than one. This wealth of phenomena is a genuine effect of quantum interference: the 
classical system for \$N{\textbackslash}geq 2\$ always behaves ergodically with an energy per site linearly increasing in time. Our results show that quantum mechanics can deeply alter the regularity/ergodicity properties of a many body driven system.},

Here we develop and experimentally demonstrate such a protocol, which uses time reversal of the many-body dynamics to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) in a long-range Ising spin quantum simulator with more than 100 ions in a Penning trap. By measuring a family of OTOCs as a function of a tunable parameter we obtain fine-grained information about the state of the system encoded in the multiple quantum coherence spectrum, extract the quantum state purity, and demonstrate the buildup of up to 8-body correlations.

	abstract = {Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in many areas of physics, ranging from cosmology and particle physics to condensed matter. A prime example is the breaking of spatial translation symmetry, which underlies the formation of crystals and the phase transition from liquid to solid. Analogous to crystals in space, the breaking of translation symmetry in time and the emergence of a "time crystal" was recently proposed, but later shown to be forbidden in thermal equilibrium. However, non-equilibrium Floquet systems subject to a periodic drive can exhibit persistent time-correlations at an emergent sub-harmonic frequency. This new phase of matter has been dubbed a "discrete time crystal" (DTC). Here, we present the first experimental observation of a discrete time crystal, in an interacting spin chain of trapped atomic ions. We apply a periodic Hamiltonian to the system under many-body localization (MBL) conditions, and observe a sub-harmonic temporal response that is robust to 
external perturbations. Such a time crystal opens the door for studying systems with long-range spatial-temporal correlations and novel phases of matter that emerge under intrinsically non-equilibrium conditions.},

But whereas ordinary crystals get their periodicity from the regular repetition of spatial elements, time crystals are an exotic, non-equilibrium state of matter in which the same structures repeat themselves in time. Predicted to exist a few years ago, time crystals have so far resisted experimental demonstration. Now, two groups offer evidence for experimental observation of this elusive form of matter. Jiehang Zhang \textit{et al}. create a specific kind of time crystala discrete time crystalin a chain of ten trapped ions under the influence of periodic driving. Mikhail Lukin and colleagues achieve a similar feat using approximately one million nitrogenvacancy spin impurities in diamond as an experimental platform. In both cases, the time-crystalline order is shown to be robust to external perturbations. Such time crystals could potentially find applications in robust quantum memory.

By rotating the spin operators into the local spin reference frame, we evaluate the zeroth, first, and second order terms in a Holstein–Primakoff expansion, and through a Green's functions approach, we determine the structure factor intensities for the spin-wave frequencies. To demonstrate this technique, we examine the spin-wave dynamics of the generalized Villain model with a varying interchain interaction. The new interchain coupling expands the overall phase diagram with the realization of two non-equivalent canted spin configurations. The rotational Holstein–Primakoff expansion provides both analytical and numerical results for the spin dynamics and intensities of these phases.},

	abstract = {Slow variations (quenches) of the magnetic field across the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition of spin systems produce heat. In short-ranged systems the heat exhibits a universal power-law scaling as a function of the quench rate, known as Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling. Attempts to extend this hypothesis to long-range interacting systems have lead to seemingly contradicting results. In this work we analyse slow quenches of the magnetic field in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, which describes fully-connected quantum spins. We determine the quantum contribution to the residual heat as a function of the quench rate by means of a Bogoliubov expansion about the mean-field value and calculate the exact solution. For a quench which ends at the quantum critical point we identify two regimes: the adiabatic limit for finite-size chains, where the scaling is dominated by the Landau-Zener tunneling, and the KZ scaling. For a quench symmetric about the critical point, instead, there is no KZ scaling. 
Here we identify three regimes depending on the velocity of the ramp and on the size of the system: (i) the adiabatic limit for finite-size chains; (ii) the opposite regime, namely, the thermodynamic limit, where the residual heat is independent of the quench rate; and finally (iii) the intermediate regime, which is a crossover between the two solutions. We argue that this behaviour is a property of all-connected spin systems. Our findings agree with previous studies and identify the respective limits in which they hold.},

Applying the singular value decomposition naturally separates the degrees of freedom to local and nonlocal, and simplifies the positivity inequalities. It also allows us to geometrically represent a state as two entangled Bloch spheres with superimposed correlation axes. It is shown that unitary transformations, local or nonlocal, have simple interpretations as axis rotations or mixing of certain degrees of freedom. The nonlocal unitary invariants of the state are then derived in terms of local unitary invariants. The positive partial transpose criterion for entanglement is generalized, and interpreted as a reflection, or a change

Here, we consider the noninteracting counterpart of that model in order to explore its phase diagram as a function of the strength of the disordered potential, the driving frequency and its amplitude. We will first of all mimic the experimental procedure of the experiment and use the even-odd sites imbalance as a parameter in order to discern between different phases. Then we compute the Floquet eigenstates and relate the localisation-delocalisation transition to their Inverse Participation Ratio. Both these approaches show that the delocalisation transition occurs for frequencies that 
are low compared to the bandwidth of the time independent model. Moreover, in agreement with the results of the experiment there is an amplitude threshold below which no delocalisation transition occurs. We estimate both the critical values for the frequency and the amplitude.},

Here, we establish an alternative platform by reporting on the observation of coherent, fully interaction-driven quantum revivals of the magnetization in Rydberg-dressed Ising spin chains of atoms trapped in an optical lattice. We identify partial many-body revivals at up to about ten times the characteristic time scale set by the interactions. At the same time, single-site-resolved correlation measurements link the magnetization dynamics with interspin correlations appearing at different distances during the evolution.

We provide a detailed mean-field analysis of the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the system parameters, the leakage, and the external driving and show the emergence of a number of different quantum phases. A photon crystal associated with a spatial modulation of the photon blockade appears. The steady state can also display oscillating behavior and bistability. In some regions the crystalline ordering may coexist with the oscillating behavior. Furthermore, we study the effect of short-range quantum fluctuations by employing a cluster mean-field analysis. Focusing on the corrections to the photon crystal boundaries, we show that, apart 
for some quantitative differences, the cluster mean field supports the findings of the simple single-site analysis. In the last part of the paper we concentrate on the possibility of building up the class of arrays introduced here, by means of superconducting circuits of existing technology.

When the two-photon detuning is blueshifted and the latter ratio is less than 1, bistability exists among the phases.

At this interface, the standard techniques and intuitions of both fields are called into question, obscuring issues as fundamental as the role of fluctuations, dimensionality, and symmetry on the nature of collective behavior and phase transitions. Here, we study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, a minimal description of numerous atomic, optical, and solid-state systems in which particle loss is countered by coherent driving. Despite being a lattice version of optical bistability, a foundational and patently nonequilibrium model of cavity QED, the steady state possesses an emergent equilibrium description in terms of a classical Ising model. We establish this picture by 
making new connections between traditional techniques from many-body physics (functional integrals) and quantum optics (the system-size expansion). To lowest order in a controlled expansion—organized around the experimentally relevant limit of weak interactions—the full quantum dynamics reduces to nonequilibrium Langevin equations, which support a phase transition described by model A of the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Numerical simulations of the Langevin equations corroborate this picture, revealing that canonical behavior associated with the Ising model manifests readily in simple experimental observables.},

	abstract = {We study a coupled array of coherently driven photonic cavities, which maps onto a driven-dissipative XY spin-12 model with ferromagnetic couplings in the limit of strong optical nonlinearities. Using a site-decoupled mean-field approximation, we identify steady-state phases with canted antiferromagnetic order, in addition to limit cycle phases, where oscillatory dynamics persist indefinitely. We also identify collective bistable phases, where the system supports two steady states among spatially uniform, antiferromagnetic, and limit cycle phases. We compare these mean-field results to exact quantum trajectory simulations for finite one-dimensional arrays. The exact results exhibit short-range antiferromagnetic order for parameters that have significant overlap with the mean-field phase diagram. In the mean-field bistable regime, the exact quantum dynamics exhibits real-time collective switching between macroscopically distinguishable states. We present a clear physical picture for this dynamics 
and establish a simple relationship between the switching times and properties of the quantum Liouvillian.},

For this purpose, we develop a self-consistent expansion in the inverse coordination number of the array () to solve the Lindblad master equation of these systems beyond the mean-field approximation. Our formalism is compared and benchmarked with exact numerical methods for small systems based on an exact diagonalization of the Liouvillian and a recently developed corner-space renormalization technique. We then apply this method to obtain insights beyond mean-field in two particular settings: (i) we show that the gas–liquid transition in the driven-dissipative Bose–Hubbard model is characterized by large density fluctuations and bunched photon statistics. (ii) We study the antibunching–bunching transition of the nearest-neighbor correlator in the driven-dissipative spin-1/2 XY model and provide a simple explanation of this phenomenon.},

	abstract = {The study of open quantum systems – microscopic systems exhibiting quantum coherence that are coupled to their environment – has become increasingly important in the past years, as the ability to control quantum coherence on a single particle level has been developed in a wide variety of physical systems. In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-
body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems. Control over dissipative processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible 
via current techniques.},

We report local measurements of the onset of superconducting pairing in the high-transition temperature (Tc) superconductor BiSCCO using a lattice-tracking spectroscopy technique with a scanning tunneling microscope. We can determine the temperature dependence of the pairing energy gaps, the electronic excitations in the absence of pairing, and the effect of the local coupling of electrons to bosonic excitations. Our measurements reveal that the strength of pairing is determined by the unusual electronic excitations of the normal state, suggesting that strong electron-electron interactions rather than low-energy (<0.1 volts) electron-boson interactions are responsible for superconductivity in the cuprates.}

abstract = {A Bose-Einstein condensate was produced in a vapor of rubidium-87 atoms that was confined by magnetic fields and evaporatively cooled. The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 1012 per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.}

Using a tunable quantum gas of bosonic cesium atoms, we realized and controlled in one-dimensional geometry a highly excited quantum phase that is stabilized in the presence of attractive interactions by maintaining and strengthening quantum correlations across a confinement-induced resonance. We diagnosed the crossover from repulsive to attractive interactions in terms of the stiffness and energy of the system. Our results open up the experimental study of metastable, excited, many-body phases with strong correlations and their dynamical properties.}

If the system is in a pure, zero-entropy quantum state, it is expected to remain so even after quenching. How do we then reconcile statistical mechanics with quantum laws? To address this question, Kaufman et al. used their quantum microscope to study strings of six rubidium atoms confined in the wells of an optical lattice (see the Perspective by Polkovnikov and Sels). When tunneling along the strings was suddenly switched on, the strings as a whole remained in a pure state, but smaller subsets of two or three atoms conformed to a thermal distribution. The force driving the thermalization was quantum entanglement.Science, this issue p. 794; see also p. 752Statistical mechanics relies on the maximization of entropy in a system at thermal equilibrium. However, an isolated quantum many-body system initialized in a pure state remains pure during Schr{\"
o}dinger evolution, and in this sense it has static, zero entropy. We experimentally studied the emergence of statistical mechanics in a quantum state and observed the fundamental role of quantum entanglement in facilitating this emergence. Microscopy of an evolving quantum system indicates that the full quantum state remains pure, whereas thermalization occurs on a local scale. We directly measured entanglement entropy, which assumes the role of the thermal entropy in thermalization. The entanglement creates local entropy that validates the use of statistical physics for local observables. Our measurements are consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.},

The classification is based on the properties of the transition rather than the microscopic details of the underlying system. Iftikhar et al. exploited this fact to study QPTs in clean, tunable nanostructures, rather than in complex materials, where they most often occur. Within a single nanostructure, two different classes of QPTs with profoundly different characters were studied and comprehensively characterized.Science, this issue p. 1315Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are ubiquitous in strongly correlated materials. However, the microscopic complexity of these systems impedes the quantitative understanding of QPTs. We observed and thoroughly analyzed the rich strongly correlated physics in two profoundly dissimilar regimes of quantum criticality. With a circuit implementing a quantum simulator for the three-channel Kondo model, we 
reveal the universal scalings toward different low-temperature fixed points and along the multiple crossovers from quantum criticality. An unanticipated violation of the maximum conductance for ballistic free electrons is uncovered. The present charge pseudospin implementation of a Kondo impurity opens access to a broad variety of strongly correlated phenomena.},

  abstract={Circuit QED techniques have been instrumental in manipulating and probing with exquisite sensitivity the quantum state of superconducting quantum bits coupled to microwave cavities. Recently, it has become possible to fabricate new devices in which the superconducting quantum bits are replaced by hybrid mesoscopic circuits combining nanoconductors and metallic reservoirs. This mesoscopic QED provides a new experimental playground to study the light–matter interaction in electronic circuits. Here, we present the experimental state of the art of mesoscopic QED and its theoretical description. A first class of experiments focuses on the artificial atom limit, where some quasiparticles are trapped in nanocircuit bound states. In this limit, the circuit QED techniques can be used to manipulate and probe electronic degrees of freedom such as confined charges, spins, or Andreev pairs. A second class of experiments uses cavity photons to reveal the dynamics of electron tunneling between a nanoconductor 
and fermionic reservoirs. For instance, the Kondo effect, the charge relaxation caused by grounded metallic contacts, and the photo-emission caused by voltage-biased reservoirs have been studied. The tunnel coupling between nanoconductors and fermionic reservoirs also enable one to obtain split Cooper pairs, or Majorana bound states. Cavity photons represent a qualitatively new tool to study these exotic condensed matter states.}

  abstract={We consider the physics of an optomechanical cavity subject to coherent two-phonon driving, i.e. degenerate parametric amplification of the mechanical mode. We show that in such a system, the cavity mode can effectively ‘inherit’ parametric driving from the mechanics, yielding phase-sensitive amplification and squeezing of optical signals reflected from the cavity. We also demonstrate how such a system can be used to perform single-quadrature detection of a near-resonant narrow-band force applied to the mechanics with extremely low added noise from the optics. The system also exhibits strong differences from a conventional degenerate parametric amplifier: in particular, the cavity spectral function can become negative, indicating a negative effective photon temperature.}

abstract="A renormalization scheme for interacting fermionic systems is presented where the renormalization is carried out in terms of the fermionic degrees of freedom. The scheme is based on continuous unitary transformations of the Hamiltonian which stays hermitian throughout the renormalization flow, whereby any frequency dependence is avoided. The approach is illustrated in detail for a model of spinless fermions with nearest neighbour repulsion in one dimension. Even though the fermionic degrees of freedom do not provide an easy starting point in one dimension favorable results are obtained which agree well with the exact findings based on Bethe ansatz.",

  abstract={These lecture notes give a short review of methods such as the matrix ansatz, the additivity principle or the macroscopic fluctuation theory, developed recently in the theory of non-equilibrium phenomena. They show how these methods allow us to calculate the fluctuations and large deviations of the density and the current in non-equilibrium steady states of systems like exclusion processes. The properties of these fluctuations and large deviation functions in non-equilibrium steady states (for example, non-Gaussian fluctuations of density or non-convexity of the large deviation function which generalizes the notion of free energy) are compared with those of systems at equilibrium.}

@article{LiuEtAlNatPhoton16,
	Annote = {Two-dimensional atomic crystals of graphene, as well as transition-metal dichalcogenides, have emerged as a class of materials that demonstrate strong interaction with light. This interaction can be further controlled by embedding such materials into optical microcavities. When the interaction rate is engineered to be faster than dissipation from the light and matter entities, one reaches the `strong coupling'regime. This results in the formation of half-light, half-matter bosonic quasiparticles called microcavity polaritons. Here, we report evidence of strong light--matter coupling and the formation of microcavity polaritons in a two-dimensional atomic crystal of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) embedded inside a dielectric microcavity at room temperature. A Rabi splitting of 46 $\pm$3 meV is observed in angle-resolved reflectivity and photoluminescence spectra due to coupling between the two-dimensional excitons and the cavity photons. Realizing strong coupling at room temperature in two-dimensional 
materials that offer a disorder-free potential landscape provides an attractive route for the development of practical polaritonic devices.},

In optics, though, the weakness with which photons interact with each other makes exploring such behaviour more difficult. Here we describe an optical system that exhibits strongly correlated dynamics on a mesoscopic scale. By adding photons to a two-dimensional array of coupled optical cavities each containing a single two-level atom in the photon-blockade regime, we form dressed states, or polaritons, that are both long-lived and strongly interacting. Our results predict that at zero temperature the system will undergo a characteristic Mott insulator (excitations localized on each site) to superfluid (excitations delocalized across the lattice) quantum phase transition. Moreover, the ability to couple light to and from individual cavities of this system could be useful in the realization of 
tuneable quantum simulators and other quantum-mechanical devices.},

Exerting control over the state of individual elements within such a system is even more so, and represents a hurdle in the realization of quantum computing devices. Substantial progress has been achieved with arrays of Josephson junctions and cold atoms in optical lattices, where detailed control over collective properties is feasible, but addressing individual sites remains a challenge. Here we show that a system of polaritons held in an array of resonant optical cavities—which could be realized using photonic crystals or toroidal microresonators—can form a strongly interacting many-body system showing quantum phase transitions, where individual particles can be controlled and measured. The system also offers the possibility to generate attractive on-site potentials yielding highly entangled states and a phase with particles much more delocalized than in 
superfluids.},

After this has been achieved in individual micro-cavities representing an effectively zero-dimensional volume, this line of research has shifted its focus towards engineering devices where such strong optical nonlinearities simultaneously occur in extended volumes of multiple nodes of a network. Recent technological progress in several experimental platforms now opens the possibility to employ the systems of strongly interacting photons, these give rise to as quantum simulators. Here we review the recent development and current status of this research direction for theory and experiment. Addressing both, optical photons interacting with atoms and microwave photons in networks of superconducting circuits, we focus on analogue quantum simulations in scenarios where effective photon-photon interactions exceed 
dissipative processes in the considered platforms.},

In circuit QED, this model is implemented by combining microwave resonators and superconducting qubits on a microchip with unprecedented experimental control. Arranging qubits and resonators in the form of a lattice realizes a new kind of Hubbard model, the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, in which the elementary excitations are polariton quasi-particles. Due to the genuine openness of photonic systems, circuit QED lattices offer the possibility to study the intricate interplay of collective behavior, strong correlations and non-equilibrium physics. Thus, turning circuit QED into an architecture for quantum simulation, i.e., using a well-controlled system to mimic the intricate quantum behavior of another system too daunting for a theorist to tackle head-on, is an exciting idea which has served as theorists’ playground for a while and is now also 
starting to catch on in experiments. This review gives a summary of the most recent theoretical proposals and experimental efforts.},

Much recent excitement has focused on a new implementation of quantum simulators using superconducting circuits, where conventional microchip fabrication can be used to take design concepts to experimental reality, quickly and flexibly. Because the quantum ‘particles’ in these simulators are circuit excitations rather than physical particles subject to conservation laws, superconducting simulators provide a complement to ultracold atoms by naturally accessing non-equilibrium physics. Here, we review the recent wealth of theoretical explorations and experimental prospects of realizing these new devices.},

A deeper understanding of the role of topology in physics has led to a new class of matter—topologically ordered systems. The best known examples are quantum Hall effects, where insensitivity to local properties manifests itself as conductance through edge states that is insensitive to defects and disorder. Current research into engineering topological order primarily focuses on analogies to quantum Hall systems, where the required magnetic field is synthesized in non-magnetic systems. Here, we realize synthetic magnetic fields for photons at room temperature, using linear silicon photonics. We observe, for the first time, topological edge states of light in a two-dimensional system and show their robustness against intrinsic and introduced disorder. Our experiment demonstrates the feasibility of using photonics to realize topological order

  abstract={Recent experimental developments in diverse areas—ranging from cold atomic gases to light-driven semiconductors to microcavity arrays—move systems into the focus which are located on the interface of quantum optics, many-body physics and statistical mechanics. They share in common that coherent and driven–dissipative quantum dynamics occur on an equal footing, creating genuine non-equilibrium scenarios without immediate counterpart in equilibrium condensed matter physics. This concerns both their non-thermal stationary states and their many-body time evolution. It is a challenge to theory to identify novel instances of universal emergent macroscopic phenomena, which are tied unambiguously and in an observable way to the microscopic drive conditions. In this review, we discuss some recent results in this direction. Moreover, we provide a systematic introduction to the open system Keldysh functional integral approach, which is the proper technical tool to accomplish a merger of quantum optics and 
many-body physics, and leverages the power of modern quantum field theory to driven open quantum systems.}

  abstract={Topological states of fermionic matter can be induced by means of a suitably engineered dissipative dynamics. Dissipation then does not occur as a perturbation, but rather as the main resource for many-body dynamics, providing a targeted cooling into topological phases starting from arbitrary initial states. We explore the concept of topological order in this setting, developing and applying a general theoretical framework based on the system density matrix that replaces the wave function appropriate for the discussion of Hamiltonian ground-state physics. We identify key analogies and differences to the more conventional Hamiltonian scenario. Differences essentially arise from the fact that the properties of the spectrum and of the state of the system are not as tightly related as in the Hamiltonian context. We provide a symmetry-based topological classification of bulk steady states and identify the classes that are achievable by means of quasi-local dissipative processes driving into superfluid 
paired states. We also explore the fate of the bulk-edge correspondence in the dissipative setting and demonstrate the emergence of Majorana edge modes. We illustrate our findings in one- and two-dimensional models that are experimentally realistic in the context of cold atoms.}

	abstract = {We theoretically investigate a photonic Kagomé lattice which can be realized in microwave cavity arrays using current technology. The Kagomé lattice exhibits an exotic band structure with three bands, one of which can be made completely flat. The presence of artificial gauge fields makes it possible to emulate topological phases and induce chiral edge modes which can coexist inside the energy gap with the flat band that is topologically trivial. By tuning the artificial fluxes or in the presence of disorder, the flat band can also acquire a bandwidth in energy allowing the coexistence between chiral edge modes and bulk extended states; in this case the chiral modes become fragile towards scattering into the bulk. The photonic system then exhibits equivalents of both a quantum Hall effect without Landau levels and an anomalous Hall effect characterized by a nonquantized Chern number. We discuss experimental observables such as local density of states and edge currents. We show how synthetic 
uniform magnetic fields can be engineered, which allows an experimental probe of Landau levels in the photonic Kagomé lattice. We then draw on semiclassical Boltzmann equations for transport to devise a method to measure Berry's phases around loops in the Brillouin zone. The method is based solely on wave-packet interference and can be used to determine band Chern numbers or the photonic equivalent of the anomalous Hall response. We demonstrate the robustness of these measurements towards on-site and gauge-field disorder. We also show the stability of the anomalous quantum Hall phase for nonlinear cavities and for (artificial) atom-photon interactions.},

We show that in the circuit-QED architecture, this can be achieved by inserting simple superconducting circuits into the resonator junctions. In the presence of such coupling elements, constant parallel magnetic and electric fields suffice to break time-reversal symmetry. We support these theoretical predictions with numerical simulations for realistic sample parameters, specify general conditions under which time reversal is broken, and discuss the application to chiral Fock-state transfer, an on-chip circulator, and tunable band structure for the Kagome lattice.},

We explore the dynamical critical properties of the Hepp–Lieb–Dicke phase transition by performing quenches across the phase boundary. We observe hysteresis in the transition between a homogeneous phase and a self-organized collective phase with an enclosed loop area showing power-law scaling with respect to the quench time, which suggests an interpretation within a general framework introduced by Kibble and Zurek. The observed hysteretic dynamics is well reproduced by numerically solving the mean-field equation derived from a generalized Dicke Hamiltonian. Our work promotes the understanding of nonequilibrium physics in open many-body systems with infinite range interactions.},

	abstract = {We review recent developments regarding the quantum dynamics and many-body physics with light, in superconducting circuits and Josephson analogues, by analogy with atomic physics. We start with quantum impurity models addressing dissipative and driven systems. Both theorists and experimentalists are making efforts towards the characterization of these non-equilibrium quantum systems. We show how Josephson junction systems can implement the equivalent of the Kondo effect with microwave photons. The Kondo effect can be characterized by a renormalized light frequency and a peak in the Rayleigh elastic transmission of a photon. We also address the physics of hybrid systems comprising mesoscopic quantum dot devices coupled with an electromagnetic resonator. Then, we discuss extensions to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) Networks allowing one to engineer the Jaynes–Cummings lattice and Rabi lattice models through the presence of superconducting qubits in the cavities. This opens the door to novel many-
body physics with light out of equilibrium, in relation with the Mott–superfluid transition observed with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices. Then, we summarize recent theoretical predictions for realizing topological phases with light. Synthetic gauge fields and spin–orbit couplings have been successfully implemented in quantum materials and with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices — using time-dependent Floquet perturbations periodic in time, for example — as well as in photonic lattice systems. Finally, we discuss the Josephson effect related to Bose–Hubbard models in ladder and two-dimensional geometries, producing phase coherence and Meissner currents. The Bose–Hubbard model is related to the Jaynes–Cummings lattice model in the large detuning limit between light and matter (the superconducting qubits). In the presence of synthetic gauge fields, we show that Meissner currents subsist in an insulating Mott phase.
Résumé
Nous passons en revue des développements récents concernant la dynamique quantique hors équilibre et la physique de la lumière dans des circuits supraconducteurs et analogues de Josephson, par analogie avec les systèmes de physique atomique. Nous commençons par des modèles quantiques d'impuretés reliés à des systèmes dissipatifs et contrôlés. Théoriciens et expérimentateurs accomplissent des efforts en vue de la caractérisation de ces systèmes quantiques hors équilibre. Nous montrons comment les systèmes de jonctions Josephson peuvent servir à implémenter l'équivalent de l'effet Kondo avec des photons micro-onde. L'effet Kondo peut se caractériser par une fréquence lumineuse renormalisée et par un pic dans la transmission élastique Rayleigh d'un photon. Nous nous intéressons aussi à la physique des systèmes hybrides comprenant des dispositifs à points quantiques mésoscopiques couplés à un résonateur électromagnétique. Ensuite, nous discuterons des modèles de réseaux d'électrodynamique quantiques (QED) 
permettant de concevoir des modèles de réseaux de Jaynes–Cummings et de Rabi, via la présence de qubits supraconducteurs dans les cavités. Ceci ouvre la porte nouvelle physique pour le problème à N-corps dans les systèmes lumineux hors équilibre, en relation avec la transition Mott-superfluide observée avec des atomes ultra-froids dans des réseaux optiques. Nous résumons aussi des prédictions théoriques récentes pour réaliser des phases topologiques avec de la lumière. Des champs de jauge synthétiques et des couplages spin–orbite ont été mis en œuvre avec succès dans les matériaux quantiques et dans les systèmes d'atomes ultra-froids piégés dans des réseaux optiques – en utilisant des perturbations de Floquet périodiques dans le temps – ainsi que dans les systèmes de réseaux photoniques artificiels. Finalement, nous discutons l'effet Josephson lié aux modèles de Bose–Hubbard dans des géométries en échelle ainsi qu'à deux dimensions, produisant de la cohérence de phase et des courants Meissner. Le modèle de 
Bose–Hubbard est aussi lié au modèle de Jaynes–Cummings sur réseau. En présence de champs de jauge synthétiques, nous montrons que les courants Meissner subsistent dans une phase de Mott isolante.},

	Abstract = {Understanding dissipation in 2D quantum many-body systems is an open challenge which has proven remarkably difficult. Here we show how numerical simulations for this problem are possible by means of a tensor network algorithm that approximates steady states of 2D quantum lattice dissipative systems in the thermodynamic limit. Our method is based on the intuition that strong dissipation kills quantum entanglement before it gets too large to handle. We test its validity by simulating a dissipative quantum Ising model, relevant for dissipative systems of interacting Rydberg atoms, and benchmark our simulations with a variational algorithm based on product and correlated states. Our results support the existence of a first order transition in this model, with no bistable region. We also simulate a dissipative spin 1/2 XYZ model, showing that there is no re-entrance of the ferromagnetic phase. Our method enables the computation of steady states in 2D quantum lattice systems.},

  abstract={The phenomenon of spontaneous synchronization, particularly within the framework of the Kuramoto model, has been a subject of intense research over the years. The model comprises oscillators with distributed natural frequencies interacting through a mean-field coupling, and serves as a paradigm to study synchronization. In this review, we put forward a general framework in which we discuss in a unified way known results with more recent developments obtained for a generalized Kuramoto model that includes inertial effects and noise. We describe the model from a different perspective, highlighting the long-range nature of the interaction between the oscillators, and emphasizing the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of its dynamics from a statistical physics point of view. In this review, we first introduce the model and discuss both for the noiseless and noisy dynamics and for unimodal frequency distributions the synchronization transition that occurs in the stationary state. We then 
introduce the generalized model, and analyze its dynamics using tools from statistical mechanics. In particular, we discuss its synchronization phase diagram for unimodal frequency distributions. Next, we describe deviations from the mean-field setting of the Kuramoto model. To this end, we consider the generalized Kuramoto dynamics on a one-dimensional periodic lattice on the sites of which the oscillators reside and interact with one another with a coupling that decays as an inverse power-law of their separation along the lattice. For two specific cases, namely, in the absence of noise and inertia, and in the case when the natural frequencies are the same for all the oscillators, we discuss how the long-time transition to synchrony is governed by the dynamics of the mean-field mode (zero Fourier mode) of the spatial distribution of the oscillator phases.}

	abstract = {This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in the fundamental understanding and active control of quantum fluids of light in nonlinear optical systems. In the presence of effective photon-photon interactions induced by the optical nonlinearity of the medium, a many-photon system can behave collectively as a quantum fluid with a number of novel features stemming from its intrinsically nonequilibrium nature. A rich variety of recently observed photon hydrodynamical effects is presented, from the superfluid flow around a defect at low speeds, to the appearance of a Mach-Cherenkov cone in a supersonic flow, to the hydrodynamic formation of topological excitations such as quantized vortices and dark solitons at the surface of large impenetrable obstacles. While the review is mostly focused on a specific class of semiconductor systems that have been extensively studied in recent years (planar semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime having cavity 
polaritons as elementary excitations), the very concept of quantum fluids of light applies to a broad spectrum of systems, ranging from bulk nonlinear crystals, to atomic clouds embedded in optical fibers and cavities, to photonic crystal cavities, to superconducting quantum circuits based on Josephson junctions. The conclusive part of the article is devoted to a review of the future perspectives in the direction of strongly correlated photon gases and of artificial gauge fields for photons. In particular, several mechanisms to obtain efficient photon blockade are presented, together with their application to the generation of novel quantum phases.},

@article{OrgiuEtAlNatMat16,
	Annote = {Much effort over the past decades has been focused on improving carrier mobility in organic thin-film transistors by optimizing the organization of the material or the device architecture. Here we take a different path to solving this problem, by injecting carriers into states that are hybridized to the vacuum electromagnetic field. To test this idea, organic semiconductors were strongly coupled to plasmonic modes to form coherent states that can extend over as many as 105 molecules and should thereby favour conductivity. Experiments show that indeed the current does increase by an order of magnitude at resonance in the coupled state, reflecting mostly a change in field-effect mobility. A theoretical quantum model confirms the delocalization of the wavefunctions of the hybridized states and its effect on the conductivity. Our findings illustrate the potential of engineering the vacuum electromagnetic environment to modify and to improve properties of materials.},

Here we show that molecular vibrational modes of the electronic ground state can also be coherently coupled with a microcavity mode at room temperature, given the low vibrational thermal occupation factors associated with molecular vibrations, and the collective coupling of a large ensemble of molecules immersed within the cavity-mode volume. This enables the enhancement of the collective Rabi-exchange rate with respect to the single-oscillator coupling strength. The possibility of inducing large shifts in the vibrational frequency of selected molecular bonds should have immediate consequences for chemistry.},

Their measurement in solids is the subject of an intense scientific debate focused on seeking a methodology capable of establishing a direct link between the variance of the atomic displacements and experimentally measurable observables. Here we address this issue by means of non-equilibrium optical experiments performed in shot-noise-limited regime. The variance of the time-dependent atomic positions and momenta is directly mapped into the quantum fluctuations of the photon number of the scattered probing light. A fully quantum description of the non-linear interaction between photonic and phononic fields is benchmarked by unveiling the squeezing of thermal phonons in {$[$}alpha{$]$}-quartz.},

@article{KlembtEtAlNature18,
	Abstract = {Topological insulators---materials that are insulating in the bulk but allow electrons to flow on their surface---are striking examples of materials in which topological invariants are manifested in robustness against perturbations such as defects and disorder1. Their most prominent feature is the emergence of edge states at the boundary between areas with different topological properties. The observable physical effect is unidirectional robust transport of these edge states. Topological insulators were originally observed in the integer quantum Hall effect2 (in which conductance is quantized in a strong magnetic field) and subsequently suggested3--5 and observed6 to exist without a magnetic field, by virtue of other effects such as strong spin--orbit interaction. These were systems of correlated electrons. During the past decade, the concepts of topological physics have been introduced into other fields, including microwaves7,8, photonic systems9,10, cold atoms11,12, acoustics13,14 and even 
mechanics15. Recently, topological insulators were suggested to be possible in exciton-polariton systems16--18 organized as honeycomb (graphene-like) lattices, under the influence of a magnetic field. Exciton-polaritons are part-light, part-matter quasiparticles that emerge from strong coupling of quantum-well excitons and cavity photons19. Accordingly, the predicted topological effects differ from all those demonstrated thus far. Here we demonstrate experimentally an exciton-polariton topological insulator. Our lattice of coupled semiconductor microcavities is excited non-resonantly by a laser, and an applied magnetic field leads to the unidirectional flow of a polariton wavepacket around the edge of the array. This chiral edge mode is populated by a polariton condensation mechanism. We use scanning imaging techniques in real space and Fourier space to measure photoluminescence and thus visualize the mode as it propagates. We demonstrate that the topological edge mode goes around defects, and that its 
propagation direction can be reversed by inverting the applied magnetic field. Our exciton-polariton topological insulator paves the way for topological phenomena that involve light--matter interaction, amplification and the interaction of exciton-polaritons as a nonlinear many-body system.},

	abstract = {Messy, interacting quantum-mechanical systems are difficult to analyze theoretically. In a single spatial dimension, the calculations are still tractable, and experiments have recently confirmed the prediction that sufficiently strong disorder can disrupt the transport of interacting particles. In two dimensions, however, the theoretical blueprint is missing. Choi et al. used single-site imaging of cold 87Rb atoms in an optical lattice to show that similar localization occurs in two-dimensional (2D) systems. The study highlights the power of quantum simulation to solve problems that are currently inaccessible to classical computing techniques.Science, this issue p. 1547A fundamental assumption in statistical physics is that generic closed quantum many-body systems thermalize under their own dynamics. Recently, the emergence of many-body localized systems has questioned this concept and challenged our understanding of the connection between statistical physics and quantum mechanics. Here we 
report on the observation of a many-body localization transition between thermal and localized phases for bosons in a two-dimensional disordered optical lattice. With our single-site{\textendash}resolved measurements, we track the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared out-of-equilibrium density pattern and find strong evidence for a diverging length scale when approaching the localization transition. Our experiments represent a demonstration and in-depth characterization of many-body localization in a regime not accessible with state-of-the-art simulations on classical computers.},

  abstract={We study the real-time dynamics of a two-dimensional Anderson-Hubbard model using nonequilibrium self-consistent perturbation theory within the second-Born approximation. When compared with exact diagonalization performed on small clusters, we demonstrate that for strong disorder this technique approaches the exact result on all available timescales, while for intermediate disorder, in the vicinity of the many-body localization transition, it produces quantitatively accurate results up to nontrivial times. Our method allows for the treatment of system sizes inaccessible by any numerically exact method and for the complete elimination of finite-size effects for the times considered. We show that for a sufficiently strong disorder the system becomes nonergodic, while for intermediate disorder strengths and for all accessible timescales transport in the system is strictly subdiffusive. We argue that these results are incompatible with a simple percolation picture, but are consistent with the 
heuristic random resistor network model where subdiffusion may be observed for long times until a crossover to diffusion occurs. The prediction of slow finite-time dynamics in a two-dimensional interacting and disordered system can be directly verified in future cold-atoms experiments.}

  volume={2016},
  number={3},
  pages={033101},
    year={2016},
  abstract={A fully many-body localized (FMBL) quantum disordered system is characterized by the emergence of an extensive number of local conserved operators that prevents the relaxation towards thermal equilibrium. These local conserved operators can be seen as the building blocks of the whole set of eigenstates. In this paper, we propose to construct them explicitly via block real-space renormalization. The principle is that each renormalization group step diagonalizes the smallest remaining blocks and produces a conserved operator for each block. The final output for a chain of N spins is a hierarchical organization of the N conserved operators with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2016/3/033101/jstataa11ddieqn001.gif] {$\left(\frac{\ln N}{\ln 2}\right)$} layers. The system size nature of the conserved operators of the top layers is necessary to describe the possible long-range order of the excited eigenstates and the possible critical points between different FMBL phases. We discuss the 
similarities and the differences with the strong disorder RSRG-X method that generates the whole set of the 2 N eigenstates via a binary tree of N layers. The approach is applied to the long-range quantum spin-glass Ising model, where the constructed excited eigenstates are found to be exactly like ground states in another disorder realization, so that they can be either in the paramagnetic phase, in the spin-glass phase or critical.}

For the case of periodic quenches between two Hamiltonians (or periodic kicks), where the time-evolution operator over one period reduces to the product of two simple transfer matrices, we propose a block-self-dual renormalization procedure to construct the localized eigenstates of the Floquet dynamics. We also discuss the corresponding strong disorder renormalization procedure, that generalizes the RSRG-X procedure to construct the localized eigenstates of time-independent Hamiltonians.}

  abstract={The Lindblad dynamics with dephasing in the bulk and magnetization-driving at the two boundaries is studied for the quantum spin chain with random fields h j and couplings J j (that can be either uniform or random). In the regime of strong disorder in the random fields, or in the regime of strong bulk-dephasing, the effective dynamics can be mapped onto a classical simple symmetric exclusion process with quenched disorder in the diffusion coefficient associated to each bond. The properties of the corresponding non-equilibrium-steady-state in each disordered sample between the two reservoirs are studied in detail by extending the methods that have been previously developed for the symmetric exclusion process without disorder. Explicit results are given for the magnetization profile, for the two-point correlations, for the mean current and for the current fluctuations, in terms of the random fields and couplings defining the disordered sample.}

The eigenvalue problem of the associated Floquet operator maps onto an effective hopping problem. Using the effective model, we establish conditions on the spectral properties of the two Hamiltonians for the system to localize in energy space. We find that ergodic systems always delocalize in energy space and heat up to infinite temperature, for both local and global driving. In contrast, many-body localized systems with quenched disorder remain localized at finite energy. We support our conclusions by numerical simulations of disordered spin chains. We argue that our results hold for general driving protocols, and discuss their experimental implications. "

Much recent excitement has focused on a new implementation of quantum simulators using superconducting circuits, where conventional microchip fabrication can be used to take design concepts to experimental reality, quickly and flexibly. Because the quantum {\textquoteleft}particles{\textquoteright} in these simulators are circuit excitations rather than physical particles subject to conservation laws, superconducting simulators provide a complement to ultracold atoms by naturally accessing non-equilibrium physics. Here, we review the recent wealth of theoretical explorations and experimental prospects of realizing these new devices.

	Abstract = {Superconducting circuits are a competitive platform for quantum computation because they offer controllability, long coherence times and strong interactions---properties that are essential for the study of quantum materials comprising microwave photons. However, intrinsic photon losses in these circuits hinder the realization of quantum many-body phases. Here we use superconducting circuits to explore strongly correlated quantum matter by building a Bose--Hubbard lattice for photons in the strongly interacting regime. We develop a versatile method for dissipative preparation of incompressible many-body phases through reservoir engineering and apply it to our system to stabilize a Mott insulator of photons against losses. Site- and time-resolved readout of the lattice allows us to investigate the microscopic details of the thermalization process through the dynamics of defect propagation and removal in the Mott phase. Our experiments demonstrate the power of superconducting circuits for studying 
strongly correlated matter in both coherent and engineered dissipative settings. In conjunction with recently demonstrated superconducting microwave Chern insulators, we expect that our approach will enable the exploration of topologically ordered phases of matter.},

  abstract={We present a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the concept of quantum non-Markovianity, a central theme in the theory of open quantum systems. We introduce the concept of a quantum Markovian process as a generalization of the classical definition of Markovianity via the so-called divisibility property and relate this notion to the intuitive idea that links non-Markovianity with the persistence of memory effects. A detailed comparison with other definitions presented in the literature is provided. We then discuss several existing proposals to quantify the degree of non-Markovianity of quantum dynamics and to witness non-Markovian behavior, the latter providing sufficient conditions to detect deviations from strict Markovianity. Finally, we conclude by enumerating some timely open problems in the field and provide an outlook on possible research directions.}

	abstract = {We experimentally study the influence of dissipation on the driven Dicke quantum phase transition, realized by coupling external degrees of freedom of a Bose{\textendash}Einstein condensate to the light field of a high-finesse optical cavity. The cavity provides a natural dissipation channel, which gives rise to vacuum-induced fluctuations and allows us to observe density fluctuations of the gas in real-time. We monitor the divergence of these fluctuations over two orders of magnitude while approaching the phase transition, and observe a behavior that deviates significantly from that expected for a closed system. A correlation analysis of the fluctuations reveals the diverging time scale of the atomic dynamics and allows us to extract a damping rate for the external degree of freedom of the atoms. We find good agreement with our theoretical model including dissipation via both the cavity field and the atomic field. Using a dissipation channel to nondestructively gain information about a quantum 
many-body system provides a unique path to study the physics of driven-dissipative systems.},

Mean-field theory provides a framework to understand the main features of the condensation and the role of interactions between particles. Various properties of these systems are discussed, including the density profiles and the energy of the ground-state configurations, the collective oscillations and the dynamics of the expansion, the condensate fraction and the thermodynamic functions. The thermodynamic limit exhibits a scaling behavior in the relevant length and energy scales. Despite the dilute nature of the gases, interactions profoundly modify the static as well as the dynamic properties of the system; the predictions of mean-field theory are in excellent agreement with available experimental results. Effects of superfluidity including the existence of quantized vortices and the reduction of the moment of inertia are discussed, as well as the consequences of coherence such as 
the Josephson effect and interference phenomena. The review also assesses the accuracy and limitations of the mean-field approach.},

Relevant collective excitations of this light{\textendash}matter system are polaritonic in nature, allowing access to the quantum critical behavior of the Dicke model through light leaking out of the cavity. This opens the path to using photodetection-based quantum optical techniques to study the dynamics and excitations of this elementary quantum critical system. We first discuss the photon flux observed at the cavity face and find that it displays a different scaling law near criticality than that obtained from the mean-field theory for the equivalent closed system. Next, we study the second-order correlation measurements of photons leaking out of the cavity. Finally, we discuss a modulation technique that directly captures the softening of polaritonic excitations. Our analysis takes 
into account the effect of the finite size of the system, which may result in an effective symmetry-breaking term.},

	abstract = {A phase transition describes the sudden change of state of a physical system, such as melting or freezing. Quantum gases provide the opportunity to establish a direct link between experiments and generic models that capture the underlying physics. The Dicke model describes a collective matter{\textendash}light interaction and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose{\textendash}Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-range interactions between the condensed atoms, induced by two-photon processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the 
phase transition is mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. Our results should facilitate studies of quantum gases with long-range interactions and provide access to novel quantum phases.

BEC has, for example, famously been demonstrated in dilute atom gas of rubidium atoms at temperatures below 200 nanokelvin. Much effort has been devoted to finding a solid-state system in which BEC can take place. Promising candidate systems are semiconductor microcavities, in which photons are confined and strongly coupled to electronic excitations, leading to the creation of exciton polaritons. These bosonic quasi-particles are 109 times lighter than rubidium atoms, thus theoretically permitting BEC to occur at standard cryogenic temperatures. Here we detail a comprehensive set of experiments giving compelling evidence for BEC of polaritons. Above a critical density, we observe massive occupation of the ground state developing from a polariton 
gas at thermal equilibrium at 19 K, an increase of temporal coherence, and the build-up of long-range spatial coherence and linear polarization, all of which indicate the spontaneous onset of a macroscopic quantum phase.},

In the thermodynamic limit and at low frequencies, we show that the distribution function of the photonic mode is thermal, with an effective temperature set by the atom-photon interaction strength. This behavior characterizes the static and dynamic critical exponents of the associated superradiance transition. Motivated by these considerations, we develop a general Keldysh path-integral approach that allows us to study physically relevant nonlinearities beyond the idealized Dicke model. Using standard diagrammatic techniques, we take into account the leading-order corrections due to the finite number N of atoms. For finite N, the photon mode behaves as a damped classical nonlinear oscillator at finite temperature. For the atoms, we propose a Dicke action that can be solved for any N and correctly captures the atoms{\textquoteright} depolarization 
due to dissipative dephasing.},

	abstract = {We investigate the near-critical dynamics of atomic density fluctuations in the nonequilibrium self-organization transition of an optically driven quantum gas coupled to a single mode of a cavity. In this system cavity-mediated long-range interactions between atoms, tunable by the drive strength, lead to softening of an excitation mode recently observed in experiments. This phenomenon has previously been studied within a two-mode approximation for the collective motional degrees of freedom of the atomic condensate, which results in an effective open-system Dicke model. Here, including the full spectrum of atomic modes we find a finite lifetime for a rotonlike mode in the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum that is strongly pump dependent. The corresponding decay rate and critical exponents for the phase transition are calculated explaining the nonmonotonic pump-dependent atomic damping rate observed in recent experiments. We compute the near-critical behavior of the intracavity field fluctuations 
that has been previously shown to be enhanced with respect to the equilibrium Dicke model in a two-mode approximation. We highlight the role of the finite size of the system in the suppression of it below the expectations of the open Dicke model.},

  abstract={The exact steady-state solution for the reduced atomic density operator for a model system of N identical two-level atoms confined to a single site (the Dicke model) and driven by a totally incoherent broad-band (chaotic) field is derived through the equivalent Fokker-Planck equation of the system. Steady-state values of the atomic observables, higher moments and atomic fluctuations are calculated for an arbitrary N and an arbitrary field strength. It is shown that when the chaotic field is a thermal (black-body) field the atomic system is driven into a steady relative occupation number that obeys the Boltzmann distribution law only for N=1. (The same result for N>1 atoms can be reached only if the cooperative interactions between the atoms are ignored.) In the thermodynamic limit N to infinity there is no critical behaviour in contrast to the resonant coherently driven case. It is also shown that semiclassical (direct) factorisation of the equations of motion does not lead to the correct results 
for the N to infinity limit of the exact quantum case. Within the exact theory numerical results for finite N (<or=100) are presented for the time-dependent expectation values of the atomic operators, the intensity and the intensity autocorrelation function. Superradiant pulses are emitted by N initially inverted atoms but as the incident intensity is increased this superradiant behaviour is obscured. The steady-state fluorescence spectrum is a single Lorentzian of width proportional to N in the weak-field case. In the strong-field case the spectrum is insensitive to the number of atoms and the result is similar to the one-atom situation. Photon bunching and antibunching effects are investigated for the weak- and strong-field limits. When the chaotic driving field is simply a single-mode thermal field the approach to atomic saturation is delayed in comparison with the case of the broad-band chaotic field.}

	abstract = {This is a review of state-of-the-art theory and experiment of the motion of cold and ultracold atoms coupled to the radiation field within a high-finesse optical resonator in the dispersive regime of the atom-field interaction with small internal excitation. The optical dipole force on the atoms together with the backaction of atomic motion onto the light field gives rise to a complex nonlinear coupled dynamics. As the resonator constitutes an open driven and damped system, the dynamics is nonconservative and in general enables cooling and confining the motion of polarizable particles. In addition the emitted cavity field allows for real-time monitoring of the particle{\textquoteright}s position with minimal perturbation up to subwavelength accuracy. For many-body systems, the resonator field mediates controllable long-range atom-atom interactions, which set the stage for collective phenomena. Besides the correlated motion of distant particles, one finds critical behavior and nonequilibrium 
phase transitions between states of different atomic order in conjunction with superradiant light scattering. Quantum-degenerate gases inside optical resonators can be used to emulate optomechanics as well as novel quantum phases such as supersolids and spin glasses. Nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions as predicted by, e.g., the Dicke Hamiltonian can be controlled and explored in real time via monitoring the cavity field. In combination with optical lattices, the cavity field can be utilized for nondestructive probing Hubbard physics and tailoring long-range interactions for ultracold quantum systems.},

Nonlinear Josephson physics was first observed in superfluid helium and atomic condensates, but it has remained inaccessible in photonic systems because it requires large photon{\textendash}photon interactions. Here we report on the observation of nonlinear Josephson oscillations of two coupled polariton condensates confined in a photonic molecule formed by two overlapping micropillars etched in a semiconductor microcavity. At low densities we observe coherent oscillations of particles tunnelling between the two sites. At high densities, interactions quench the transfer of particles, inducing the macroscopic self-trapping of polaritons in one of the micropillars. The finite lifetime results in a dynamical transition from self-trapping to oscillations 
with $\pi$ phase. Our results open the way to the experimental study of highly nonlinear regimes in photonic systems, such as chaos or symmetry-breaking bifurcations.},

We explore the intrinsic time scales for reaching these asymptotic states and discuss the implications for finite-duration experiments.

The strongly interacting nature of the superfluid phase manifests itself in terms of additional gapped modes in the spectra. Comparison is made to recent analytical work on the Bose-Hubbard model. Despite some subtle differences due to the polaritonic particles in the cavity model, the gross features are found to be very similar to the Bose-Hubbard case.

In the presence of effective photon-photon interactions induced by the optical nonlinearity of the medium, a many-photon system can behave collectively as a quantum fluid with a number of novel features stemming from its intrinsically nonequilibrium nature. A rich variety of recently observed photon hydrodynamical effects is presented, from the superfluid flow around a defect at low speeds, to the appearance of a Mach-Cherenkov cone in a supersonic flow, to the hydrodynamic formation of topological excitations such as quantized vortices and dark solitons at the surface of large impenetrable obstacles. While the review is mostly focused on a specific class of semiconductor systems that have been extensively studied in recent years (planar semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime having cavity 
polaritons as elementary excitations), the very concept of quantum fluids of light applies to a broad spectrum of systems, ranging from bulk nonlinear crystals, to atomic clouds embedded in optical fibers and cavities, to photonic crystal cavities, to superconducting quantum circuits based on Josephson junctions. The conclusive part of the article is devoted to a review of the future perspectives in the direction of strongly correlated photon gases and of artificial gauge fields for photons. In particular, several mechanisms to obtain efficient photon blockade are presented, together with their application to the generation of novel quantum phases.},

The cavity-based system is intrinsically open: photons leak out of the cavity where they are detected. Even at zero temperature, the continuous weak measurement of the photon number leads to an irreversible dynamics toward a steady state. In the framework of a generalized Bogoliubov theory, we show that the steady state exhibits a dynamical quantum phase transition. We find that the critical point and the mean field are only slightly modified with respect to the phase transition in the ground state. However, the critical exponents of the singular quantum correlations are significantly different in the two cases. There is also a drastic modification of the atom-field entanglement, since the divergence of the logarithmic negativity of the ground state at the 
critical point is suppressed and a finite entanglement is found in the steady state.},

A recent Monte Carlo study of the superfluid density on the square lattice suggested that this does not hold for the fixed-density transition through the Mott lobe tip. Instead, mean-field behavior with a dynamical critical exponent z=2 was found. We perform large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the critical behavior of the superfluid density and the compressibility. We find z=1 at the tip of the insulating lobe.

However, the most omnipresent Bose gas, blackbody radiation (radiation in thermal equilibrium with the cavity walls) does not show this phase transition. In such systems photons have a vanishing chemical potential, meaning that their number is not conserved when the temperature of the photon gas is varied; at low temperatures, photons disappear in the cavity walls instead of occupying the cavity ground state. Theoretical works have considered thermalization processes that conserve photon number (a prerequisite for BEC), involving Compton scattering with a gas of thermal electrons or photon{\textendash}photon scattering in a nonlinear resonator configuration. Number-conserving thermalization was 
experimentally observed for a two-dimensional photon gas in a dye-filled optical microcavity, which acts as a {\textquoteleft}white-wall{\textquoteright} box. Here we report the observation of a Bose{\textendash}Einstein condensate of photons in this system. The cavity mirrors provide both a confining potential and a non-vanishing effective photon mass, making the system formally equivalent to a two-dimensional gas of trapped, massive bosons. The photons thermalize to the temperature of the dye solution (room temperature) by multiple scattering with the dye molecules. Upon increasing the photon density, we observe the following BEC signatures: the photon energies have a Bose{\textendash}Einstein distribution with a massively populated ground-state mode on top of a broad thermal wing; the phase transition occurs at the expected photon density and exhibits the predicted dependence on cavity geometry; and the ground-state mode emerges even for a spatially displaced pump spot. The prospects of the observed 
effects include studies of extremely weakly interacting low-dimensional Bose gases and new coherent ultraviolet sources.},

By adding photons to a two-dimensional array of coupled optical cavities each containing a single two-level atom in the photon-blockade regime, we form dressed states, or polaritons, that are both long-lived and strongly interacting. Our results predict that at zero temperature the system will undergo a characteristic Mott insulator (excitations localized on each site) to superfluid (excitations delocalized across the lattice) quantum phase transition. Moreover, the ability to couple light to and from individual cavities of this system could be useful in the realization of

An equivalent Keldysh real-time functional integral reformulation opens up the problem to a practical evaluation using the tools of quantum field theory. In particular, we develop a functional renormalization group approach to quantitatively explore the universality class of this stationary nonequilibrium system. Key results comprise the emergence of an asymptotic thermalization of the distribution function, while manifest nonequilibrium properties are witnessed in the response properties in terms of a new, independent critical exponent. Thus, the driven-dissipative microscopic nature is seen to bear observable consequences on the largest length scales. The absence of two

	abstract = {Photon-mediated interactions between atoms are of fundamental importance in quantum optics, quantum simulations, and quantum information processing. The exchange of real and virtual photons between atoms gives rise to nontrivial interactions, the strength of which decreases rapidly with distance in three dimensions. Here, we use two superconducting qubits in an open one-dimensional transmission line to study much stronger photon-mediated interactions. Making use of the possibility to tune these qubits by more than a quarter of their transition frequency, we observe both coherent exchange interactions at an effective separation of 3$\lambda$/4 and the creation of super- and subradiant states at a separation of one photon wavelength $\lambda$. In this system, collective atom-photon interactions and applications in quantum communication may be explored.
Artificial Complexity
Quantum optics probes the interactions between light and matter. Building up from a simple, single-atom system, the exchange of virtual photons between systems of several (or many) atoms is expected to give rise to many exotic effects. Because controlling the separation of the atoms on the atomic scale is experimentally challenging, artificial atom systems may provide a more tractable route for systematic study, as described by van Loo et al. (p. 1494, published online 14 November). Using a system of two separate superconducting qubits in a microwave transmission line, they show how the interaction between the two qubits can be controlled and mediated by electromagnetic modes. The results illustrate a feasible route to probing the complexity of many-body effects that may otherwise be difficult to realize.},

  abstract={A time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method with a matrix product ansatz is employed for explicit computation of non-equilibrium steady state density operators of several integrable and non-integrable quantum spin chains, which are driven far from equilibrium by means of Markovian couplings to external baths at the two ends. It is argued that even though the time evolution cannot be simulated efficiently due to fast entanglement growth, the steady states in and out of equilibrium can be typically accurately approximated, with the result that chains of length of the order of n ≈100 spins are accessible. Our results are demonstrated by performing explicit simulations of steady states and calculations of energy/spin densities/currents in several problems of heat and spin transport in quantum spin chains. A previously conjectured relation between quantum chaos and normal transport is re-confirmed with high accuracy for much larger systems.}

Confined to one spatial dimension their low energy physics is that of a moving-frame Luttinger liquid which, due to the nonlocal character of the repulsive interaction, can form a Wigner crystal of individual photons. We calculate the Luttinger K parameter using density-matrix renormalization group simulations and find that under typical slow-light conditions kinetic energy contributions are too strong for crystal formation. However, adiabatically increasing the polariton mass by turning a light pulse into stationary spin excitations allows us to generate true crystalline order over a finite length. The dynamics of this process and asymptotic correlations are analyzed in terms of a time-dependent Luttinger theory.},

The collective behaviour of interacting particles gives rise to diverse fundamental phenomena such as confinement in quantum chromodynamics, electron fractionalization in the quantum Hall regime and phase transitions in unconventional superconductors and quantum magnets. Such systems typically involve massive particles, but optical photons can also interact with one another in a nonlinear medium. In practice, however, such interactions are often very weak. Here we describe a technique that enables the creation of a strongly correlated quantum gas of photons using one-dimensional optical systems with tight field confinement and coherent photon trapping techniques. The confinement enables the generation of large, tunable optical nonlinearities via the interaction of photons with a nearby cold atomic gas. In its extreme, we show that a quantum light field can undergo fermionization in such one-
dimensional media, which can be probed via standard photon correlation measurements.},

	Annote = {The thermodynamic description of many-particle systems rests on the assumption of ergodicity, the ability of a system to explore all allowed configurations in the phase space. Recent studies on many-body localization have revealed the existence of systems that strongly violate ergodicity in the presence of quenched disorder. Here, we demonstrate that ergodicity can be weakly broken by a different mechanism, arising from the presence of special eigenstates in the many-body spectrum that are reminiscent of quantum scars in chaotic non-interacting systems. In the single-particle case, quantum scars correspond to wavefunctions that concentrate in the vicinity of unstable periodic classical trajectories. We show that many-body scars appear in the Fibonacci chain, a model with a constrained local Hilbert space that has recently been experimentally realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator. The quantum scarred eigenstates are embedded throughout the otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum but lead 
to direct experimental signatures, as we show for periodic recurrences that reproduce those observed in the experiment. Our results suggest that scarred many-body bands give rise to a new universality class of quantum dynamics, opening up opportunities for the creation of novel states with long-lived coherence in systems that are now experimentally realizable.},

However, in the presence of interactions such systems are expected to eventually heat up to a simple infinite-temperature state. One possible exception is a periodically driven many-body localized system, in which heating is precluded by strong disorder. Here, we use a gas of ultracold fermionic potassium atoms in optical lattices to prepare and probe such a driven system and show that it is indeed stable for high enough driving frequency. Moreover, we find a novel regime in which the system is exceedingly stable even at low drive frequencies, a particular feature of our driving scheme. Our experimental findings are well supported by numerical simulations and may provide avenues for engineering novel phases in periodically driven matter.},

  abstract={Time crystals are time-periodic self-organized structures postulated by Frank Wilczek in 2012. While the original concept was strongly criticized, it stimulated at the same time an intensive research leading to propositions and experimental verifications of discrete (or Floquet) time crystals—the structures that appear in the time domain due to spontaneous breaking of discrete time translation symmetry. The struggle to observe discrete time crystals is reviewed here together with propositions that generalize this concept introducing condensed matter like physics in the time domain. We shall also revisit the original Wilczek’s idea and review strategies aimed at spontaneous breaking of continuous time translation symmetry.}

In particular, the local structure of high-order stability sets is shown to approach universality, rescaling in successive bifurcations, asymptotically by the ratio$\alpha$ ($\alpha$ = 2.5029078750957... forz = 2). This structure is determined by a universal functiong*
(x), where the 2nth iterate off,f(n), converges locally to$\alpha$−ng*($\alpha$nx) for largen. For the class off's considered, there exists a$\lambda$n such that a 2n-point stable limit cycle including                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\backslash}bar x{\$}{\$}                 exists;$\lambda$∞ −$\lambda$n R{\textasciitilde}$\delta$−n ($\delta$ = 4.669201609103... forz = 2). The numbers$\alpha$ and$\delta$ have been computationally determined for a range ofz through their definitions, for a variety off's for eachz. We present a recursive mechanism that explains these results by determiningg* as the fixed-point (function) of a transformation on the class off's. At present our treatment is heuristic. In a sequel, an exact theory is formulated and specific problems of rigor isolated.",

  abstract={It has been recently argued that an inhomogeneous system could rotate spontaneously in its ground state —hence a “time crystal” which is periodic in time. In this letter we present a very simple example: a superfluid ring threaded by a magnetic field which develops a charge density wave (CDW). A simple calculation shows that diamagnetic currents cannot drive rotation of the CDW, with a clear picture of the cancellation mechanism.}

We show that this interacting system is dynamically stable to periodic drives with finite frequency and amplitude. This finding is in contrast to the common belief that periodically-driven unbounded interacting systems should always tend to an absorbing infinite-temperature state. The transition to an unstable absorbing state is described by a change in the sign of the kinetic term in the Floquet Hamiltonian and controlled by the short-wavelength degrees of freedom. We investigate the stability phase diagram through an analytic high-frequency expansion, a self-consistent variational approach, and a numeric semiclassical calculation. Classical and quantum experiments are proposed to verify the validity of our results.},

Here, starting from a nontechnical introduction with emphasis on the Floquet picture and effective Hamiltonians, we review the recent applications of Floquet engineering in ultrafast, nonlinear phenomena in the solid state. In particular, Floquet topological states and their application to ultrafast spintronics and strongly correlated electron systems are overviewed.},

Dissipation then does not occur as a perturbation, but rather as the main resource for many-body dynamics, providing a targeted cooling into topological phases starting from arbitrary initial states. We explore the concept of topological order in this setting, developing and applying a general theoretical framework based on the system density matrix that replaces the wave function appropriate for the discussion of Hamiltonian ground-state physics. We identify key analogies and differences to the more conventional Hamiltonian scenario. Differences essentially arise from the fact that the properties of the spectrum and of the state of the system are not as tightly related as in the Hamiltonian context. We provide a symmetry-based topological classification of bulk steady states and identify the classes that are achievable by means of quasi-local dissipative processes driving into 
superfluid paired states. We also explore the fate of the bulk-edge correspondence in the dissipative setting and demonstrate the emergence of Majorana edge modes. We illustrate our findings in one- and two-dimensional models that are experimentally realistic in the context of cold atoms.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are a new phase of matter1, with the striking property that conduction of electrons occurs only on their surfaces1,2,3. In two dimensions, electrons on the surface of a topological insulator are not scattered despite defects and disorder, providing robustness akin to that of superconductors. Topological insulators are predicted to have wide-ranging applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing and spintronics. Substantial effort has been directed towards realizing topological insulators for electromagnetic waves4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. One-dimensional systems with topological edge states have been demonstrated, but these states are zero-dimensional and therefore exhibit no transport properties11,12,14. Topological protection of microwaves has been observed using a mechanism similar to the quantum Hall effect15, by placing a gyromagnetic photonic crystal in an external magnetic field5. But because magnetic effects are very weak at optical frequencies, realizing photonic 
topological insulators with scatter-free edge states requires a fundamentally different mechanism—one that is free of magnetic fields. A number of proposals for photonic topological transport have been put forward recently6,7,8,9,10. One suggested temporal modulation of a photonic crystal, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing one-way edge states10. This is in the spirit of the proposed Floquet topological insulators16,17,18,19, in which temporal variations in solid-state systems induce topological edge states. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a photonic topological insulator free of external fields and with scatter-free edge transport—a photonic lattice exhibiting topologically protected transport of visible light on the lattice edges. Our system is composed of an array of evanescently coupled helical waveguides20 arranged in a graphene-like honeycomb lattice21,22,23,24,25,26. Paraxial diffraction of light is described by a Schrödinger equation where the propagation coordinate (z) 
acts as ‘time’27. Thus the helicity of the waveguides breaks z-reversal symmetry as proposed for Floquet topological insulators. This structure results in one-way edge states that are topologically protected from scattering.},

Here we study the building blocks for simulating quantum spin Hamiltonians with trapped ions2. We experimentally simulate the adiabatic evolution of the smallest non-trivial spin system from paramagnetic into ferromagnetic order with a quantum magnetization for two spins of 98\%. We prove that the transition is not driven by thermal fluctuations but is of quantum-mechanical origin (analogous to quantum fluctuations in quantum phase transitions3). We observe a final superposition state of the two degenerate spin 
configurations for the ferromagnetic order ({\textbar}↑↑〉+{\textbar}↓↓〉), corresponding to deterministic entanglement achieved with 88\% fidelity. This method should allow for scaling to a higher number of coupled spins2, enabling implementation of simulations that are intractable on conventional computers.},

We determine the structure and properties of the phase diagram and identify the universality class of the transition, both for the statics and the dynamics. We show that the proper dynamical order parameter is in fact not the excitation density and find evidence that the dynamical transition is in the “model A” universality class; i.e., it features a nontrivial Z2 symmetry and a dynamics with nonconserved order parameter. This sheds light on some relevant and observable aspects of dynamical transitions in Rydberg gases. In particular it permits a quantitative understanding of a recent experiment [C. Carr, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 113901 (2013)] which observed bistable behavior as well as power-law scaling of the relaxation time. The latter emerges not due to critical slowing down in the vicinity of a

Their simulation on conventional computers is impossible, since quantum behaviour arising with superposition states or entanglement is not efficiently translatable into the classical language. However, one could gain deeper insight into complex quantum dynamics by experimentally simulating the quantum behaviour of interest in another quantum system, where the relevant parameters and interactions can be controlled and robust effects detected sufficiently well. Systems of trapped ions provide unique control of both the internal (electronic) and external (motional) degrees of freedom. The mutual Coulomb interaction between the ions allows for large interaction strengths at comparatively large mutual ion distances enabling individual control and readout. Systems of trapped ions therefore exhibit a prominent 
system in several physical disciplines, for example, quantum information processing or metrology. Here, we will give an overview of different trapping techniques of ions as well as implementations for coherent manipulation of their quantum states and discuss the related theoretical basics. We then report on the experimental and theoretical progress in simulating quantum many-body physics with trapped ions and present current approaches for scaling up to more ions and more-dimensional systems.}

The study of magnetic frustration has a long history in solid-state physics, but cold-atom systems now offer the possibility of simulating the problem with exquisite control. Islam et al. (p. 583) study a system of 16 trapped ions, using the Coulomb interactions between the ions to simulate exchange interactions present in magnetic systems. The measured spin correlations provide a window into the behavior of the system, as the effective magnetic field and the range of the interactions are tuned.
Frustration, or the competition between interacting components of a network, is often responsible for the emergent complexity of many-body systems. For instance, frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such as quantum spin liquids, spin glasses, and spin ices, whose ground states can be massively degenerate and carry high degrees of quantum entanglement. Here, we engineer frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions between spins stored in a crystal of up to 16 trapped 171Yb+ atoms. We control the amount of frustration by continuously tuning the range of interaction and directly measure spin correlation functions and their coherent dynamics. This prototypical quantum simulation points the way toward a new probe of frustrated quantum magnetism and perhaps the design of new quantum materials.
Coulomb interactions in a system of 16 trapped ions are used to simulate magnetism with varying degrees of frustration.

We experimentally generate MBL states by applying an Ising Hamiltonian with long-range interactions and programmable random disorder to ten spins initialized far from equilibrium. Using experimental and numerical methods we observe the essential signatures of MBL: initial-state memory retention, Poissonian distributed energy level spacings, and evidence of long-time entanglement growth.

Within a mean-field approximation, we find a rich phase diagram with uniform, spin density wave, antiferromagnetic and oscillatory phases, as well as regions of phase bistability. We study the phase diagram of small quantum systems using exact diagonalisation, and compare the results to the mean-field theory. We find that while expectation values only capture the uniform phases of the mean-field theory, fluctuations about these expectation values give signatures of spatially non-uniform phases and bistabilities. We find these signatures for all ratios of the Ising to XY interaction, showing that they appear to be general features of spin\$-1/2\$ systems},

	abstract = {The interplay between dissipation and internal interactions in quantum many-body systems gives rise to a wealth of novel phenomena. Here we investigate spin-1/2 chains with uniform local couplings to a Markovian environment using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. For the open XXZ model, we discover that the decoherence time diverges in the thermodynamic limit. The coherence decay is then algebraic instead of exponential. This is due to a vanishing gap in the spectrum of the corresponding Liouville superoperator and can be explained on the basis of a perturbative treatment. In contrast, decoherence in the open transverse-field Ising model is found to be always exponential. In this case, the internal interactions can both facilitate and impede the environment-induced decoherence.},

	abstract = {By generalizing concepts from classical stochastic dynamics, we establish the basis for a theory of metastability in Markovian open quantum systems. Partial relaxation into long-lived metastable states—distinct from the asymptotic stationary state—is a manifestation of a separation of time scales due to a splitting in the spectrum of the generator of the dynamics. We show here how to exploit this spectral structure to obtain a low dimensional approximation to the dynamics in terms of motion in a manifold of metastable states constructed from the low-lying eigenmatrices of the generator. We argue that the metastable manifold is in general composed of disjoint states, noiseless subsystems, and decoherence-free subspaces.},

	abstract = {We apply a recently developed theory for metastability in open quantum systems to a one-dimensional dissipative quantum Ising model. Earlier results suggest this model features either a nonequilibrium phase transition or a smooth but sharp crossover, where the stationary state changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic, accompanied by strongly intermittent emission dynamics characteristic of first-order coexistence between dynamical phases. We show that for a range of parameters close to this transition or crossover point the dynamics of the finite system displays pronounced metastability, i.e., the system relaxes first to long-lived metastable states before eventual relaxation to the true stationary state. From the spectral properties of the quantum master operator we characterize the low-dimensional manifold of metastable states, which are shown to be probability mixtures of two, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic, metastable phases. We also show that for long times the dynamics can be 
approximated by a classical stochastic dynamics between the metastable phases that is directly related to the intermittent dynamics observed in quantum trajectories and thus the dynamical phases.},
