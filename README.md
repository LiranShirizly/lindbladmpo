# Introduction

This module simulates the time-evolution of a quantum system made of interacting/coupled two-level systems (qubits).
The code uses matrix-product states (MPS) and matrix-product operator (MPO) structures to efficiently simulate an approximate solution to the evolution of a system containing many qubits.
